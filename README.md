# Lebanese Lottery Analyzer

A collection of Python scripts to retrieve, analyze, and visualize Lebanese lottery results over a given date range.
This project automates data collection, applies basic statistical analysis, and generates visual insights to explore number patterns and historical trends.

This is a personal project that is done to hone my python and data analysis skills.
